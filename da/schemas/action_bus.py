"""
ActionBus – single-channel action stream merger.

Tools call ``bus.put(action)`` to inject sub-actions (e.g. explorer
sub-agent tool calls).  The node calls ``bus.merge(primary, *secondaries)``
to yield everything in one stream for the CLI / web UI.

Lifecycle follows the owning ``AgenticNode``.
